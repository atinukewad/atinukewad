Iâ€™m interested in the application of innovative precision medicine approaches in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic and rare diseases.
Experienced in using computational tools such as Linux, R and python in the analysis of biomedical datasets generated from high throughput omic technologies to investigate tumour resistance to drug treatment, discovery of new therapeutic targets and biomarker identification for targeted therapy.
